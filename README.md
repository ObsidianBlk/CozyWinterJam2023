# Skate - N - Score

The game is an isometric, top down game. The character, **Bean**, will move in the direction pointed to by the indicator arrow at their feet. To score points, simply direct **Bean** between the score flags! **Bean's** time on the lakes is limited, so try and get as many points as possible before the timer runs out!

*Beware:* If **Bean** falls from the map, all points collected will be lost... wait, what?!
